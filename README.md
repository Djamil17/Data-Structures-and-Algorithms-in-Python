# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python

*The following is a public repository of code for Python Data Structures and Alogorithms. 

*Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina and Carlos Perez are data-engineers/scientists who also work in computational economics and social      theory 

*We will be exploring :
1. Linear Data Structures 
2. Problems in Searching and Sorting 
3. Problems in Recursion, Dynamic Programming
4. Tree Data Structures and Algorithms (binary, balanced, and b-tree) 
5. Graph Data Structures and Algorithms 
6. Problems in Linear Algebra as it applies to Economis
